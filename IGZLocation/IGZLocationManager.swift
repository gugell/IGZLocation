     location via any CLLocationManager API, and grants access to
     launch-capable monitoring API such as geofencing/region monitoring,
     significante location visits, etc.  Even if killed by the user, launch
     events triggered by monitored regions or visit patterns will cause a
     relaunch.
 
     "Always" authorization presents a significant risk to user privacy, and
     as such requesting it is discouraged unless background launch behavior
     is genuinely required.  Do not call with "always" unless
     you think users will thank you for doing so.

     startDeferredLocationUpdatesForDistance:timeout:
     
     Indicate that the application will allow the location manager to defer
     location updates until an exit criterion is met. This may allow the
     device to enter a low-power state in which updates are held for later
     delivery. Once an exit condition is met, the location manager will
     continue normal updates until this method is invoked again.
 
     Exit conditions, distance and timeout, can be specified using the constants
     CLLocationDistanceMax and CLTimeIntervalMax, respectively, if you are
     trying to achieve an unlimited distance or timeout.
 
     The CLLocationManagerDelegate will continue to receive normal updates as
     long as the application remains in the foreground. While the process is
     in the background, the device may be able to enter a low-power state for
     portions of the specified distance and time interval. While in this
     state, locations will be coalesced for later delivery.
 
     Location updates will be deferred as much as is reasonable to save
     power. If another process is using location, the device may not enter a
     low-power state and instead updates will continue normally. Deferred
     updates may be interspersed with normal updates if the device exits and
     re-enters a low-power state.

     - Parameters:
        - distance: The distance (in meters) from the current location that must be travelled before event delivery resumes. To specify an unlimited distance, pass the CLLocationDistanceMax constant.
        - timeout: The amount of time (in seconds) from the current time that must pass before event delivery resumes. To specify an unlimited amount of time, pass the CLTimeIntervalMax constant.
        - handler: The single request handler.
